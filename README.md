#Trying to 'fast learn' Unity with a journey back in time - Episode 1 "Space Invaders"

I have always developed video games from scratch: starting from a C / C ++ code base and some low-level graphics library. But times have changed ... and it's time for me to change too.

Slowly, my disinterest in tools for the 'rapid' development of videogames has been progressively replaced by a growing curiosity.

In this series of projects I propose to study and learn to use Unity trying to recreate classic videogames of the past.
