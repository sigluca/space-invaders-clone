# Space Invaders Clone
## Trying to 'fast learn' Unity with a journey back in time


I have always developed video games *from scratch*. Starting from a C/C++ code base and some low-level graphics library. But times have changed ... and it's time for me to *change too*.

Slowly, my disinterest in tools for **rapid development of videogames** has been progressively replaced by a *growing curiosity*.

In this series of projects i set out to **learn Unity** through the creation of classic videogames of the past.

### Episode 1 "Space Invaders"

The first stage of my journey is the development of one of the most famous and important videogames of the past: [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders).

I chose this game both for *emotional reasons* and because I think it is *quite simple* to implement.

In fact, the *main objective* is not the development of the game itself, but to **learn how to use the tool**.

#### Topics to study

* Unity UI
* Scenes
* Game Object
* Prefabs
* Basic collisions detection
* Sprites & Animations
* Scoring & Printing
* Saving records
